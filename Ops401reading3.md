# CISSP domain 1: Security and risk management — What you need to know for the exam
## Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
- Confidentiality:

- Implement strong authentication methods, such as PINs or biometrics, to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the account balances.
- Encrypt communication channels between the ATM and the bank's servers to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- Ensure that account balances are only displayed on the ATM screen and not stored locally to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- Integrity:

- Implement secure coding practices to prevent tampering or unauthorized modifications to the ATM software or data.
- Use digital signatures or checksums to verify the integrity of the software running on the ATM and detect any unauthorized changes.
- Employ transaction logging and auditing mechanisms to monitor and detect any unauthorized modifications or tampering with account balances.
- Availability:

- Regularly maintain and update the ATM software to address vulnerabilities and ensure system stability.
- Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure uninterrupted access to account balances even in the event of hardware or software failures.
- Employ intrusion detection and prevention systems to protect the ATM system from denial-of-service attacks or other attempts to disrupt availability.

## Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
- Principle of Least Privilege: Only granting users the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
- Defense in Depth: Implementing multiple layers of security controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption) to provide a more comprehensive and robust security posture.
- Regular Security Assessments and Audits: Conducting periodic assessments and audits to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and ensure compliance with security policies and standards.


## What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?
- Risk Assessment:

Goal/Objective: Identify and assess potential risks to the organization's assets, including people, processes, and technology.
Activities: Identify assets, identify threats and vulnerabilities, assess the likelihood and impact of risks, and prioritize risks based on their severity.
- Risk Treatment:

Goal/Objective: Develop and implement appropriate measures to mitigate or manage identified risks.
Activities: Determine risk mitigation strategies (e.g., risk avoidance, risk transfer, risk mitigation), develop risk treatment plans, implement controls, and monitor their effectiveness.

- Risk Monitoring and Review:

Goal/Objective: Continuously monitor and review the effectiveness of risk management measures and make necessary adjustments.
Activities: Monitor and assess the implemented controls, identify changes in the risk landscape, review the risk treatment plans, and update the risk management approach as needed.
